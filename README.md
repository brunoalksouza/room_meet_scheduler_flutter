# Room Meet Scheduler

<p>
This is a project that was developed using Dart and Flutter.
<br>
This project was developed because of a pain that I felt I could resolve internally within the company where I do an internship. 
<br>
<br>
I developed this application together with a co-worker where you can log in, choose one of the meeting rooms available within the company and thus schedule a time to hold a meeting.
<br>
This solution brings more organization within the company and less confusion when organizing schedules (which was done by sticking paper on the door).
<br>
<br>
This project was created with a backend where all user information and created events are stored, all in a MongoDB database, the backend is in this repository:

```

<br>
Feel free to send questions, criticisms and suggestions, if you have any ideas to improve the code you are welcome!

## Prerequisites
<p>
Make sure you have Flutter, Dart, NODE, NPM and Git installed on your system.
</p>
<br>
<p>
You will also have to initialize the backend mentioned above before doing the step by step here.
</p>
<br>
<p>
It turns out that for you to be able to run it, you will need me to authorize your IP within the database, for that you can contact me.
